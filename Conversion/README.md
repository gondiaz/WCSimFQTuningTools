## Conversion

This part of the tuning deals with the computation of the conversion factors between the measured charge and the initial particle momentum. These factors are required to properly seed the momentum in the full fiTQun full likelihood fit.

Important: makes sure that the initial position of the primary particle is the detector centre in order to avoid null charges in the distributions from not contained events.
